# 👋 Hey, I'm Pablo Andres

I'm a Mexican Australian building apps with personality that actually solve problems.
I also tour sweet international bands to Australia with my touring agency Bone Soup, 
and play satan scuzz garage noise with my band Mesa Cosa. My favourite band is the B52's and my cats name is Newt. (pic coming soon)

SOFTWARE IS POLITICS. FREE PALESTINE. 🇵🇸

## 🎯 Currently Working On

**[Button Studio](https://github.com/pibulus/button-studio)** - API button design studio  
*Customizable juicy lush buttons for single use applications*

**[RackOff](https://github.com/pibulus/rackoff)** - Desktop cleaner that makes sense  
*Mac app that doesn't take itself seriously*

**[Spellbreak](https://github.com/pibulus/spellbreak)** - Mystical break reminder  
*Unskippable screen breaks with organicaly generated moon phase messages*

## ⭐ Philosophy

**people not robots** • pro choice, pro palestine, pro wrestling

Give me SLACK or kill me - I build software that:
- Has actual personality
- Reduces friction instead of adding complexity  
- Makes intimidating stuff approachable
- Works the way you think, not the way computers think
