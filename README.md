# 👋 Hey, I'm Pablo

Building apps with personality that actually solve problems.

## 🎯 Currently Working On

**[Button Studio](https://github.com/pibulus/button-studio)** - Voice button design studio  
*Customizable recording buttons for websites*

**[RackOff](https://github.com/pibulus/rackoff)** - Desktop cleaner with attitude  
*Mac app that doesn't take itself seriously*

**[Spellbreak](https://github.com/pibulus/spellbreak)** - Mystical break reminder  
*Unskippable screen breaks with aurora effects*

## ⭐ Philosophy

**people not robots** • pro choice, pro palestine, pro wrestling

Give me SLACK or kill me - I build software that:
- Has actual personality
- Reduces friction instead of adding complexity  
- Makes intimidating stuff approachable
- Works the way you think, not the way computers think
