# 👋 Hey, I'm Pablo

Building apps that don't suck for humans who aren't robots.

## 🎯 Currently Working On

**[Button Studio](https://github.com/pibulus/button-studio)** - Voice button design studio  
*Making voice UI less corporate, more human*

**[RackOff](https://github.com/pibulus/rackoff)** - Desktop cleaner with attitude  
*Mac app that doesn't take itself seriously*

**[Spellbreak](https://github.com/pibulus/spellbreak)** - Mystical typing game  
*Break spells by typing fast*

## ⭐ Philosophy

**people not robots** • pro choice, pro palestine, pro wrestling

Give me SLACK or kill me - I build software that:
- Has personality instead of corporate speak
- Reduces friction instead of adding complexity  
- Makes scary dev stuff friendly
- Sparks joy rather than stress
