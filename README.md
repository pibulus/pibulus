*I'm a Mexican Australian building tools with personality that actually solve problems.*
*I also tour sweet international bands to Australia with my touring agency Bone Soup, and play satan scuzz garage noise with my band Mesa Cosa. I'm a Libra. My favourite band is the B52's, and my cats name is Newt.                   

SOFTWARE IS POLITICS. FREE PALESTINE. 🇵🇸

## ⭐ Philosophy

**people not robots** **democatrize the tools**

Give me SLACK or kill me - I build software that:

- Has chance for chaos and personality
- Reduces friction to empower people  
- Makes intimidating stuff approachable
- Gives the tools to the people
- Works the way we think, not the way computers think
- Can't and won't scale
- Does not have integrations
